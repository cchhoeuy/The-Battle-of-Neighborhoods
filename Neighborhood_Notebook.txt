The Battle of Neighborhoods

Chris Chhoeuy

1) Introduction/Business Problem
The purpose of this study is to help individuals who are planning to open a restaurant in Toronto, choose the right location by providing data related to the income and population, as well as similar businesses in the area.

2) Downloading and Prepping Data
I'm using Toronto's census data to pull in the population, income, and use the neighborhood shapefile and Foursquare API to gather similar businesses in the area.

Toronto's Census Data: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a

Neighborhood Shapefile: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f

3) Methodology
Use of different maps that could help an interested party decide which neighborhood is best to open a restaurant or any type of business in Toronto based on income, population and similar businesses in the area. Use of Census information along with maps to visually display the more appealing neighborhoods and Foursquare data to display the current businesses in the area.

4) Results
Looking at the maps, we can see that the majority of the restaurants are bunched on main streets and on the south of the city, although some of the wealthier neighborhoods are towards the northside of the map.

5) Discussion
I expected to see more groupings of restaurants in similar areas, however in reviewing the data, they are scattered.

6) Conclusion
This data can be used by someone interested in the Toronto area, and wanting to see what the population and income levels are, as well as businesses that are in the area.
